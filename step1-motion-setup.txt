This setup was copied from https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-webcam-server/comment-page-1/ and modified
specifically for still image capture only.


Update the Pi O/S:

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade

For convenient access from Windows via Remote Desktop, install xrdp:

   sudo apt-get install xrdp

(or install PuTTY to access the Pi command line only)

Connect the Pi camera and enable it via the desktop preferences menu or use the following:

   sudo raspi-config

Add the Pi camera as a v4l2 device to modules:

   sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

(An alternate technique is to add bcm2835-v4l2 at the bottom of the /etc/modules file.)

Reboot the Pi for the above changes to take effect:

   sudo reboot

Install the packages needed by Motion:

   sudo apt install autoconf automake build-essential pkgconf libtool git libzip-dev libjpeg-dev gettext libmicrohttpd-dev 
      libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev 
      libsqlite3-dev libwebp-dev

Get the Motion deb file for Raspian Buster from GitHub and install it:

   sudo wget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-4.3.1/pi_buster_motion_4.3.1-1_armhf.deb
   sudo dpkg -i pi_buster_motion_4.3.1-1_armhf.deb

Create and configure directories for pictures and movies:

   sudo mkdir /motion
   sudo chgrp motion /motion
   sudo chmod a+rwx /motion

Configure Motion (see motion-configuration.txt; use /motion as target_dir).

Disable the Motion daemon by editing /etc/default/motion and setting start_motion_daemon=no

Run the motion application:

   motion -c /etc/motion/motion.conf

Upon motion detection, the captured images will be stored in the /motion directory.  This directory needs to be 
purged periodically to prevent from consuming all disk space.  Application logging is directed to stderr.


RUNNING IN DAEMON MODE

The application can also be run automatically in daemon mode at boot up by setting start_motion_daemon=no in 
/etc/default/motion and setting daemon on in /etc/motion/motion.conf.  Whenever making changes to motion.conf, 
the service must be restarted as follows:

   sudo service motion restart

The motion service can be stopped using the following:

   sudo service motion stop

To determine if the motion service is running, use

   sudo service --status-all

and verify that motion is preceded by '[+]'.  If the service is not running, this will be '[-]'.
