After installation, save a copy of the original /etc/motion/motion.conf file.  Then make the following changes.

daemon: on, off (default)
   purpose: run motion as a daemon
   recommendation: set to off

stream_localhost: off, on (default)
   purpose: limits the access to the stream to the localhost
   recommendation: set to off

movie_output: off, on (default)
   purpose: creates a movie file from the stream
   recommendation: set to off (not needed for this application and just slows down the Pi)

width: (default 640)
   purpose: sets the pixel width of each frame
   recommendation: explicitly set to 640 for Pi camera to be sure

height: (default 480)
   purpose: sets the pixel height of each frame
   recommendation: explicitly set to 480 for Pi camera to be sure

picture_output: off, first, best, on (default)
   purpose: determines whether and how to output image
   recommendation: set to on

target_dir: text
   purpose: sets the directory in which to output pictures, movies, and snapshots
   recommendation: set to /motion (refer to motion-setup.txt for more details)

smart_mask_speed: 0-10, default 0 (off)
   purpose: automatically filters out pixel changes in small areas of the image
   recommendation: set to 5 if windy conditions cause false triggers

lightswitch_percent: 0-100, default 0 (off)
   purpose: suppresses motion detection when greater than this percentage of pixels change
   recommendation: may be needed for sudden illumination changes from headlights or clouds

lightswitch_frames: 1-1000, default 5
   purpose: number of frames to ignore when lightswitch triggers
   recommendation: tune if necessary

minimum_motion_frames: 1-1000, default 1
   purpose: number of frames tested for motion before motion event triggers
   recommendation: increase to 2-5 if too many false triggers

minimum_frame_time: 0-2147483647, default 0 (disabled - use framerate)
   purpose: minimum number of seconds between capturing picture frames
   recommendation: set to 1?

framerate: 2-100, default 15
   purpose: if minimum_frame_time set to 0, sets number of picture captures per second
   recommendation:  set to 2?

text_changes: on, off (default)
   purpose: overlay image with text indicating number of pixels changed from reference image
   recommendation: set to on

noise_tune: off, on (default)
   purpose: automatically adjust noise threshold to filter out camera noise
   recommendation: leave at default (on)

noise_level: 1-255; default 32
   purpose: manually sets camera noise threshold when noise_tune is off
   recommendation: use if camera noise is apparent in pictures

threshold: 1-2147483647, default 1500
   purpose: sets minimum number of pixels changed from reference image to trigger motion
   recommendation: increase if too many false triggers

threshold_tune: on, off (default)
   purpose: when on, continuously adjusts threshold for declaring motion (ignores threshold)
   recommendation: set to on if changed pixels is regularly above threshold for false triggers

vid_control_params: text, up to 4095 chars
   purpose: issues control parameters to camera (brightness, white level, etc.)
   recommendation: may be useful for adjusting camera settings
